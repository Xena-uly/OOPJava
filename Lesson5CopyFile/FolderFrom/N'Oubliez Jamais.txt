Joe Cocker 
"N'Oubliez Jamais"

Papa, Why Do You Play
All The Same Old Songs
Why Do You Sing
With The Melody

Cause Down On The Street
Somethings Goin' On
There'S A New Beat
And A Brand New Song

He Said
In My Life, There Was So Much Anger
Still I Have No Regrets
Just Like You, I Was Such A Rebel
So Dance Your Own Dance, And Never Forget

N'Oubliez Jamais
I Heard My Father Say
Every Generation Has It'S Way
A Need To Disobey

N'Oubliez Jamais
It'S In Your Destiny
A Need To Disagree
When Rules Get In The Way
N'Oubliez Jamais

Mamma, Why Do You Dance
To The Same Old Songs
Why Do You Sing
Only The Harmony

Down On The Street
Something'S Goin' On
There'S A New Beat
And A Brand New Song

She Said
In My Heart Theres A Young Girls Passion
For A Life Long Duet
Someday Soon
Someone'S Smile Will Haunt You
So Sing Your Own Song And Never Forget

What Is This Game
Searching For Love Or Fame, It'S All The Same
One Of These Days You Say That Love Will Be The Cure
I'M Not Sure
