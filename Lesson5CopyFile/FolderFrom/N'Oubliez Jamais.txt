Joe Cocker 
"N'Oubliez Jamais"

Papa, Why Do You Play
All The Same Old Songs
Why Do You Sing
With The Melody

Cause Down On The Street
Somethings Goin' On
There'S A New Beat
And A Brand New Song

He Said
In My Life, There Was So Much Anger
Still I Have No Regrets
Just Like You, I Was Such A Rebel
So Dance Your Own Dance, And Never Forget

N'Oubliez Jamais
I Heard My Father Say
Every Generation Has It'S Way
A Need To Disobey

N'Oubliez Jamais
It'S In Your Destiny
A Need To Disagree
When Rules Get In The Way
N'Oubliez Jamais
